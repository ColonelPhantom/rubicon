# Examples

The examples brp, crowds, egl, herman, nand, and leader_synch are taken from the QCOMP website 
and are part of the prism benchmark suite. We refer to qcomp.org for details.

- We use Herman in the formulation with a fixed initial state rather than a nonderministic initial state.
 
We provide three original benchmarks

- parqueues
- factory
- weatherfactory
- extended-weatherfactory
