# Reference-scripts

These scripts are to help recreate comparisons with Rubicon. 
They are not part of Rubicons functionality.

Notice that we measure time for storm's sampling capabilities with ADDs using a single sample as storm currently does not allow efficient sampling in the symbolic engine. 
This comparison is thus favouring storm as it assumes that there is no overhead when sampling different values.
